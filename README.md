**Project: Predicting Employee Salary Using Machine Learning**
Problem Statement: Create a machine learning model that will help the company in determining the salary of newly hired employees using the given data.
Company: TechWorks Consulting

Developed a regression-based machine learning model to predict the salary (CTC) of newly hired employees using real-world HR data. The project involved complete end-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling, including:

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values and outliers, converted categorical variables (like College Tier, City Type, and Role) into numerical/dummy variables, and normalized features for better model performance.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis: Identified relationships between features and target variable (CTC), and assessed data quality.

3.Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features based on domain knowledge to improve model accuracy.

4.Modeling: Implemented and compared various regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Bagging, and AdaBoost.

5.Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

6.Evaluation: Chose the best model based on RÂ² score and validation metrics. Random Forest Regressor performed best due to its ability to handle non-linearity, reduce overfitting, and deal with outliers.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
Outcome: Achieved strong model accuracy with data-driven salary prediction insights to support fair and competitive hiring practices.
